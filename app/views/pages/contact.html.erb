                <p>A nightclub (also known as a discoth√®que, disco, dance club or club) is an entertainment venue which usually operates late into the night. 
                    A nightclub is generally distinguished from bars, pubs or taverns by the inclusion of a dance floor and a DJ booth, where a DJ plays recorded music. 
                    The busiest nights for a nightclub are Friday and Saturday night.

                    The music in nightclubs is either live bands or, more commonly, a mix of songs played by a DJ through a powerful PA system. Most clubs or club nights cater to certain music genres.
